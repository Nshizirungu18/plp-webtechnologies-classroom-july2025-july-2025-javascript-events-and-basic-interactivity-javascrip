# 📘 Interactive Web Page – JavaScript Events & Basic Interactivity

This project is part of the **PLP Web Development – Week 6 Assignment**, focusing on JavaScript **events**, **DOM manipulation**, **interactive features**, and **custom form validation**.
The goal is to make a webpage feel *interactive, dynamic, and responsive* without reloading.

---

## 🚀 Project Features

### ✅ 1. Event Handling

The webpage uses JavaScript event listeners to respond to:

* Button clicks
* Form submissions
* Toggle actions
* Show/hide content actions

These interactions make the page dynamic and reactive to user behavior.

---

### 🎮 2. Interactive Elements

This project includes **multiple interactive features**, created from scratch:

#### ⭐ **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**

Switches the entire website theme between light and dark modes using CSS classes + JS events.

#### ⭐ **Click Counter**

A button that increments a counter every time it’s clicked.
Great practice for DOM updates and state management.

#### ⭐ **Collapsible FAQ Section**

Users can expand or collapse answers by clicking each question.
Perfect demonstration of DOM manipulation + event listeners.

### 📋 3. Custom Form Validation (No HTML5-only validation!)

The project includes a Sign-Up Form with:

* Name
* Email
* Password

Validation is handled entirely with JavaScript:

* Name must be at least **3 characters**
* Email must match a **valid regex pattern**
* Password must be **6+ characters**
* Error messages appear below inputs
* Success message appears upon successful validation

This ensures the user cannot submit invalid data.
